Efficient monitoring and predicting of the oceans state and its evolution is a collaborative effort of global, national and local dimension. A first and foremost requirement for such collaborative ocean observing is the need to follow well-defined and reproducible methods across activities - collectively labelled: “Ocean Best Practices” (OBP). OBP include multiple facets – strategies for structuring observing systems, sensor deployment and usage, the generation of data and information products, but also include ethical and governance aspects related to executing ocean observing. A recently established “Ocean Best Practices System” (OBPS) provides a resource for the centralized and coordinated discovery and enhancement of OBP. An open access, permanent, digital repository of OBP documentation (oceanbestpractices.org) provide the base to create superior methods for every activity in ocean observing from research to operations to applications.
One part of the OBPS is to provide the ocean observing community with the option to publish OBP related documentation in an open-access journal. This has been realized via this Frontiers Research Topic “Best Practices in Ocean Observing”.
